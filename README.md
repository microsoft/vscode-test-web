See the [web extensions guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions) to learn about web extensions.

The node module runs a local web server that serves VS Code in the browser including the extension under development. Additionally the extension tests are automatically run.

The node module provides a command line as well as an API.

## Usage

Via command line:

Test a web extension in a browser:

```sh
vscode-test-web --browserType=chromium --extensionDevelopmentPath=$extensionLocation
```

Run web extension tests:

```sh
vscode-test-web --browserType=chromium --extensionDevelopmentPath=$extensionLocation --extensionTestsPath=$extensionLocation/dist/web/test/suite/index.js
```

Open VS Code in the Browser on a folder with test data from the local disk:

```
vscode-test-web --browserType=chromium --extensionDevelopmentPath=$extensionLocation $testDataLocation
```

VS Code for the Web will open on a virtual workspace (scheme `vscode-test-web`), backed by a file system provider that gets the file/folder data from the local disk. Changes to the file system are kept in memory and are not written back to disk.

Via API:

```ts
async function go() {
  try {
    // The folder containing the Extension Manifest package.json
    const extensionDevelopmentPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../');

    // The path to module with the test runner and tests
    const extensionTestsPath = path.resolve(__dirname, './suite/index');

    // Start a web server that serves VSCode in a browser, run the tests
    await runTests({
		browserType: 'chromium',
		extensionDevelopmentPath
		extensionTestsPath
	});
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to run tests');
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

go()
```

CLI options:

|Option|Argument Description|
|-----|-----|
| --browser | The browser to launch: `chromium` (default), `firefox`, `webkit` or `none`. |
| --extensionDevelopmentPath | A path pointing to an extension under development to include. |
| --extensionTestsPath | A path to a test module to run. |
| --quality | `insiders` (default),  or `stable`. Ignored when sourcesPath is provided. |
| --sourcesPath | If set, runs the server from VS Code sources located at the given path. Make sure the sources and extensions are compiled (`yarn compile` and `yarn compile-web`). |
| --headless | If set, hides the browser. Defaults to true when an extensionTestsPath is provided, otherwise false. |
| --permission | Permission granted to the opened browser: e.g. `clipboard-read`, `clipboard-write`.  See [full list of options](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-grant-permissions). Argument can be provided multiple times. |
| --coi | If set, enables cross origin isolation. Defaults to false. |
| --folder-uri | URI of the workspace to open VS Code on. Ignored when `folderPath` is provided. |
| --extensionPath | A path pointing to a folder containing additional extensions to include. Argument can be provided multiple times. |
| --extensionId | The id of an extension include. The format is `${publisher}.${name}`. Append `@prerelease` to use the prerelease version. |
| --host | The host name the server is opened on. Defaults to `localhost`. |
| --port | The port the server is opened on. Defaults to `3000`. |
| --open-devtools | If set, opens the dev tools in the browser. |
| --verbose | If set, prints out more information when running the server. |
| --printServerLog | If set, prints the server access log. |
| --testRunnerDataDir | If set, the temporary folder for storing the VS Code builds used for running the tests |
| folderPath |  A local folder to open VS Code on. The folder content will be available as a virtual file system and opened as workspace. |

Corresponding options are available in the API.

## Development

- `yarn && yarn install-extensions`
- Make necessary changes in [`src`](./src)
- `yarn compile` (or `yarn watch`)

- run `yarn sample` to launch VS Code Browser with the `sample` extension bundled in this repo.

- run `yarn sample-tests` to launch VS Code Browser running the extension tests of the  `sample` extension bundled in this repo.
